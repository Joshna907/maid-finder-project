# Maid-Finder
Maid Finder is a web platform to find and hire verified maids using blockchain technology for secure and transparent hiring. Built with React and smart contracts to ensure trust and data integrity.


<!--  What's Missing/Incomplete:

Critical Missing Features:

1. Smart Contract Deployment
â€¢  The Solidity smart contract source code is missing
â€¢  Need to create and deploy the actual smart contract
â€¢  Missing contract deployment scripts (Hardhat/Truffle setup)
2. Payment Integration
â€¢  No actual payment processing implementation
â€¢  Missing booking/hiring system with payment flow
â€¢  No integration between frontend booking and smart contract
3. Booking/Hiring System
â€¢  Users can search maids but can't actually book them
â€¢  No appointment scheduling system
â€¢  Missing order management system
4. User Dashboard/Profile Management
â€¢  Incomplete user profile management
â€¢  No booking history for users
â€¢  No earnings/job history for maids
5. Real-time Communication
â€¢  No chat system between users and maids
â€¢  No notification system
â€¢  Missing messaging functionality
6. Advanced Features
â€¢  No rating/review system
â€¢  No background verification system
â€¢  Missing availability calendar for maids
â€¢  No automatic status updates after job completion

Technical Missing Pieces:

1. Smart Contract Code - Need to write the Solidity contract
2. Payment Gateway - Integration with actual payment methods
3. Authentication Middleware - JWT tokens for secure API access
4. Email/SMS Notifications - For booking confirmations
5. Image Optimization - For uploaded photos
6. Error Handling - Better error handling throughout the app

ğŸš€ Next Steps to Complete the Project:

1. Write and Deploy Smart Contract (High Priority)
2. Implement Booking System with Payment Flow
3. Add User Dashboard and Profile Management
4. Implement Authentication Middleware
5. Add Rating/Review System
6. Create Chat/Messaging System
7. Add Email/SMS Notifications -->
